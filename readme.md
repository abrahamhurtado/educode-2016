# My React Boilerplate

Another React boilerplate, yes.

It was made for my personal use so I can use it as a skeleton for my own projects, but feel free to use it and improve it however you want, PR are welcome :)

## What's inside?

- Universal JavaScript: server-side rendering with React and the amazing React Router.

- Support for ES201X with Babel 6.

- Express server and Webpack configs for development and production.

- CSS Modules and PostCSS for CSS greatness.

- Hot Reloading for both React components and CSS Modules for the best developer experience! (+ nodemon for server-side-only code)

## Scripts

```js
npm install
npm run dev // for dev environment
npm run start // for production environment
```
