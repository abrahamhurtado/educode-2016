# My React Boilerplate

Another React boilerplate, yes.

It was made for my personal use so I can use it as a skeleton for my own projects, but feel free to use it and improve it however you want, PR are welcome :)

## What's inside?

- Universal JavaScript: server-side rendering with React and the amazing React Router.

- Support for ES201X with Babel 6.

- Webpack configs and Express server ready for development and production.

- CSS Modules and PostCSS for CSS greatness.

- Support for Hot Module Replacement will be added to this boilerplate as soon as the new version of ```babel-plugin-react-transform``` is released.

## Scripts

```js
npm install
npm run dev // for dev environment
npm run start // for production environment
```
